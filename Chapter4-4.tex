\chapter{Beyond the minimal model}
In this chapter we will venture beyond the minimal model. The minimal model has allowed us to explain a great deal about the binding and unbinding of dCas9, especially in equilibrium conditions. In this chapter we will take a look at more complicated models and test if they are significant improvements upon the minimal model. We hope to be able to explain the dissociation data from \cite{PNAS} without losing any accuracy or even gaining accuracy for the occupation and effective on-rate data.
